      program mpc
!
! Multifunctional precompiling processor designed to work between
! CPP and FORTRAN compiler.
!-------------------------------------------------------------------
! Objectives:
!------------ 
! (1) Eliminate blank lines left by CPP and fortran style comments,
!     but keep compiler directives like C$DOACROSS in place.
!
! (2) Usually Fortran syntax does not prohibit the practice when a
!     quotation is opened on one line and closes on the next line.
!     Doing so, however, may be considered as unsafe and sloppy from
!     stylistical point of view; mpc enforces the rule when every
!     string inside quotation mark must be closed within the line. 
!   --> Optional:: activated by TRAP_SINGLE_QUOTES CPP-switch.
!
! (3) Convert _default_ size fortran real type declarations into
!     real*8.  Any mixture of lower and upper cases latters is
!     allowed in the word real. 
!     Explicitly specified size declaration, such as real*4
!     or real*16 will be left unchanged.
!   --> Optional:: activated by REAL_TO_REAL8 CPP-switch.
!
! (4) Enforce double precision accuracy for the real type constants
!     appearing anywhere in the program, for example, 1. --> 1.D0;
!     .1 --> .1D0;    9.81 --> 9.81D0;   .5e-8 --> .5D-8; 
!     1.2e+14 --> 1.2D+14 etc.
!   --> Safe. Will distinguish real type constants from look alike
!     combinations like, say format descriptors F8.4 or e12.5; or
!     logical expressions like 1.eq.i etc. Will fold line of the
!     code automatically according to fortran syntax rules, when
!     this change causes line to increase beyond 72 characters. 
!   --> Optional: activated by DOUBLE_CONST CPP-switch.
!
!
! (5) Convert _default_ size fortran integer type declarations
!     into integer*4. Explicitly specified size declaration, such
!     as integer*2 or integer*8 will be left unchanged.
!   --> Optional: activated when _both_  INT_TO_INT4 _and_
!                 REAL_TO_REAL8 CPP-switches are defined.
!
!
! (6) Convert parallelized loops over subdomains (tiles) 
!
!          do tile=0,NSUB_X*NSUB_E-1
!
!     into two nested loops. The outer is loop over parallel threads
!     (to be parallelized), and the inner is over tiles to be
!     processed by the particular thread:
!
!          do trd=0,numthreads-1
!            do tile=forward_sweep
!     or
!          do trd=0,numthreads-1
!            do tile=backward_sweep
!
!     in such a way the inner loops in the subsequent parallel
!     regions are reversed, so that each thread "zig-zags" across
!     the tiles it is processing. Automatically append SHARED/PRIVATE
!     lists with the newly introduced variables.
!   --> Optional: activated by ZIG_ZAG CPP-switch. 
!
! More detailed description for each option is available below.
!
! In the case when after they were modified, lines of the fortran
! program became longer than the prescribed width of 72 characters, 
! they are automatically folded by mpc according to the fortran
! syntax rules. 
!
! Usage: 
!-------
! Similar to CPP
!                  mpc source.file target.file
!             or
!                  mpc source.file > target.file
!             or
!                  mpc < source.file > target.file
!
! mpc is smart enough to recognize how many arguments are given,
! TWO, ONE or NONE and act accordingly. If two arguments are present,
! the first one is input file name, while the second is output, if
! only one is present, it is input; output goes to standard output;
! if NONE is present, mpc expects input from standard input, while
! output goes to standard output. The last option allows mpc to work
! as receiver in pipe with CPP:
!
!                /lib/cpp -P file.F | mpc > file.f          
!
! WARNING: Insofar as manifestations of functional deficiencies are
! agreed upon by any and all concerned parties to be imperceivable,
! and are so stipulated, it is incumbent upon said heretofore
! mentioned parties to exercise the deferment of otherwise pertinent
! maintenance procedures.
!
! And therefore, all manifestations of functional deficiencies, such
! as bugs, evidence of nonrobust behaviour or any other problems of
! any kind shall be reported to Alexander Shchepetkin, (310)-206-9381
! or alex@atmos.ucla.edu.

! which is then accepted by the compiler without warning message.
! To do so, first extract the size itself and save it into "buffr"

! at first, reject declaration where the first symbol after type
! declaration is opening bracket (this is possible only if it is
! already a F90/95 style declaration with explicit size specification
! ==> no further action is required). If the symbol is not opening
! bracket, then three possibilities may occur: (i) it is a comma,
! separating type and F90 attribute (like pointer, dimension, etc.,);
! (ii) it is still a blanc character, which means that the line
! contains just one word, say REAL, and contunues on the next line
! (typical situation in  code); or (iii) there symbols other
! that '*' (already considered above) and '(', separated by at least
! one blank space: these are etther variable names, or F90 double
! colon :: separater. In the all three cases (i -- iii) the line is
! considered as default type declaration, and should be processed.

! Recognize numerical constants of real type in the text of the

!
! Algorithm:
!-----------
! (1) Form list of indices of all dots within the line, except dots
!     which occur within quotations ' ... '. To do so, local logical
!     switch "lswtch" is used as a masking switch, it turns OFF when
!     meeting a quotation mark, when entering a region between quotes
!     and turns back ON again, when exiting.
!
! For each dot character in the list, starting from the last one,
! and moving from the right to the left: 
!
! (2) Scan the characters adjacent from the _left_ to the dot in
!     order to find the first non-blank character which is not a
!     digit (for this purpose digits are ASCII symbols with numbers
!     within the range (48:57) inclusive). This search is terminated
!     if either
!               a non-blank non-digital symbol is found
!     or
!               the 7th position (the starting position for the
!               fixed format fortran statements) has been reached.
!
!     During this search also save "is", which is position of the
!     leftmost digit among digits adjacent to the dot on the left
!     side (position of the dot itself, if there are no adjacent
!     digits on the left of it). 
!
! (3) Check weather this symbol is _NOT_ a letter, that is excluding
!     ASCII characters with numbers within the ranges of numbers
!     (65:90) or (97:122) inclusive, _OR_ weather the 7th position
!     has been reached (in this case it does not matter what the
!     symbol is). If either condition is true, continue processing,
!     otherwise terminate it.  
!
!     It should be noted that in a legal fortran code a constant
!     expression may be preceded by a mathematical operation symbol,
!     bracket, comma, dot, etc; but _NOT_ with a letter. If it
!     happens, the potential candidate for the numerical constant is
!     actually a format statement descriptor, like E16.8, and not a
!     constant of real type. These are rejected at this moment.
!
! (4) Once condition (3) holds, scan the characters adjacent on the
!     right to the dot in order to find the first non-blanc character
!     which is non a digit. This search is limited by the length of
!     the line in the case when no such symbol is found (if it is the
!     case, it is then interpreted as a blanc symbol). During this
!     search also save "ie", which is position of the last digit
!     among digits adjacent to the dot on the right (it is set to the
!     position of the dot itself, if no adjacent digits are present).
!     Along with the previously saved "is" [see (2) above], "ie"
!     forms a logical switch "is.lt.ie", indicating that there is at
!     least one digit adjacent to the dot, so further processing is
!     required.
!
! (5) Once this symbol is found, if any, or the search was terminated
!     (in this case index m is equal to lenght+1, so that that symbol
!     is blank, or ! (fortran comment), this symbol may be
!     ether
!          'e', 'E', 'd' or 'D', so that it likely belongs to the
!          constant itself. In this case scan to the right, to verify
!          that this symbol is '+', '-' or a digit. If so, the
!          expression is a floating point real type constant to be
!          converted into double precision.
!     or
!          an underscore symbol '_', which may be associated with a
!          FORTRAN 90/95-style real-valued constant with explict type
!          (kind), e.g., 1.2_4 (in which case no it is accepted "as
!          is" and no further action is taken); or a RUTGERS-style
!          constant -- e.g., 1.0_r8 or, 1.23_e8+18 -- in this case it
!          is converted into standard double presision syntax -->
!          1.0D0 and 1.23D+18. 
!     or 
!          any other character. In this case verify that it is not a
!          letter. (In a legal fortran code a constant expression may
!          be followed by a mathematical/logical operation, bracket,
!          coma, etc, but NEVER a letter. If so, the expression is a
!          fixed point real valued constant to be converted into
!          double precision. Move the rest of the line two positions
!          to the right to make room and paste "D0" immediately after
!          its last digit.
!
! NOTE: if there are more than one real constant within the line of
! the code, the order of processing is from the right to the left.
! This is done because in the case when 'D0' is pasted to the
! constant as in the step (5), the second case, the tail of the
! line is shifted to the right. Processing them in the forward order 
! will also cause shift of the dots to be processed later. So that 
! the indices indx(j+1:ndots) are no longer consistent with the
! actual position of the dots, if the dot indx(j) was found to be  
! a fixed point real type constant as defined in (5), second case.
!
! Limitations:  1. Real-valued constants should not be continued
!-------------     to the next line of fortran code.

! Recognize and transform parallel loops:
!---------- --- --------- -------- ------
! The following code segment rearranges direction of consecutive
! 'do tile=my_first,my_last' loops into zig-zag order. This version
! is designed to work in conjuction with the OpenMP version of main.F
! (or any other code), so that no parallel directive is required in
! front of the loop in order for the rearrangement to occur: it is
! simpy triggered by the occurrence of 'do tile=my_***' with possible
! blank spaces between 'tile', '=' and 'my_***', where 'my_***' may
! be anything like handcoded 'my_first,my_last' or 'my_tile_range'. 
!
! Compared to the straightforward sequence, this measure eliminates
! secondary cache misses, because after passing a synchronization
! point, each thread proceeds with the same tile it was processing
! just before the synchronization point. It also reduces the
! probability of mutual cache_line invalidation (by factor of two)
! in a multiprocessor machine, if multiprocessing is allowed for the
! subdomains adjacent in the XI direction. This is because after a
! subdomain has been processed by a processor and a synchronization
! point has been reached, all cache_lines which are going across the
! subdivision partitioning are coherent with the cache of _that_
! processor (and invalid with respect to the one working on the
! adjacent subdomain). And it is _that_ processor (and not the
! adjacent one), who proceeds with this subdomain, and therefore
! enjoys all its cache_lines coherent with its cache at this moment.

! Similarly as above, but designed to work for version of main.F,

!          do tile=0,NSUB_X*NSUB_E-1
